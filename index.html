							<h2>About me</h2>
							<p>My name is Jari. I am a 22-year-old man from Stolwijk, a small village close to Gouda. In my spare time, I like to be physically active. I try to be active every day by working out, running, kickboxing or doing some yoga. Last summer, I graduated in Life Sciences, a bachelor's study. During my graduation internship (in BioIT), I found out that I was more interested in IT. I love that it is a fast-moving space and I'm curious about how IT will shape the future. That's why I started looking for opportunities to grow in this area. I'm really looking forward to the coming years and I'm curious about what the world of IT can teach me!</p>

							<h2>My experiences</h2>
							<p>During my study in Life Sciences, I have learned a lot about the amazing world of biology that surrounds us. I’ve always been interested in the processes that determine behavior in organisms. Now that I’m learning some things about computers, I notice that the same interest is also present in this space. I really enjoy learning about how a computer thinks and makes choices, and I would love to find some work where I can expand my knowledge in this area. During my study and my time at Calco, I gained a lot of knowledge in different programming skills, such as Java, HTML, R, and SQL. You can find all of my experiences and certificates by reading through my <a href = "files/TwoPagerENG-KootJari.pdf">TwoPager</a> (click <a href = "files/TwoPagerNL-KootJari.pdf">here</a> for the Dutch version).</p>

										<h3>MetaVis</h3>
										<p>MetaVis is an application that I made for my graduation internship at the UMCU. This app is made inside 'R', a powerfull data analytics programming language. You can check out the app by click on <a href = "https://metavis.shinyapps.io/metavis/">this link.</a> </p>

										<h3>MetaVis</h3>
										<p>During my internship the goal was to visualize shotgun sequencing data. One of the best ways to get insight in your data is with a bargraph.</p>

										<h3>Get Your Picture</h3>
										<p>One of my focus points was that I made the app as user friendly as possible. I do this by dividing the app in different tabs and adding descriptive text and feedback loops wherever needed.</p>
